# Minecraft

Welcome to my personal showcase for the Flutter and Flame course. This project is an implementation of a Minecraft-like game, built using Flutter and the Flame engine.

Throughout the course, I learned how to harness Flutterâ€™s capabilities for cross-platform development and explore the power of the Flame game engine. This project runs on Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Web, and Windows, demonstrating what you can achieve with modern mobile game development techniques.

*WIP: Busy aligning with the latest Flame version*

## Getting Started
```sh
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
